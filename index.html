        <h2><span>Importance of Donating:</span>
        The need for blood and blood components is constant, so is the need for donation.
        Every day, hospitals and clinics around the world need blood and blood componets to treat patients, since most 
        surgical interventions and a great number of medical procedures require blood transfusion.</h2>

                <p>Plasma is the liquid part of your blood. It is the clear, yellowish liquid portion of blood that remains after the cells and cellular components have been removed which includes the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. Plasma is about 90% water and it makes up 55% of blood volume. Plasma contains cells, nutrients, proteins, enzymes, hormones, salts and more. Its primary objective is to move and transport material throughout the body to areas that are in need.</p></div>
